Store Inventory

Use your knowledge of CSV and File I/O and database ORMs to build a console application that allows you to easily interact with data for a store's inventory. The data needs to be cleaned from the CSV before it is to be persisted in the database. All interactions with the records should use ORM methods for viewing records, creating records, and exporting a new CSV backup.
